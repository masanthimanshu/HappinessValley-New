3) Hypnotherapy Healing

Hypnotherapy is a type of mind-body intervention in which hypnosis is used to create a state of focused attention and increased suggestibility in the treatment of a medical or psychological disorder or concern.

The form of hypnotherapy practiced by most Victorian hypnotists mainly employed direct suggestion of symptom removal, with some use of therapeutic relaxation and occasionally aversion to alcohol, drugs, etc. Cognitive behavioral hypnotherapy is an integrated psychological therapy employing clinical hypnosis and cognitive behavioral therapy. The use of CBT in conjunction with hypnotherapy may result in greater treatment effectiveness. A meta-analysis of eight different researches revealed a 70% greater improvement for patients undergoing an integrated treatment to those using CBT only.
